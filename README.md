# SelenicSparkApp2 WebAPI

# Project was abandoned because I have no interest in researching monolithic architectures any further, 3rd iteration of the app is in progress (using microservices). 

Second version of my [SelenicSparkApp project](https://github.com/HardcoreMagazine/SelenicSparkApp). 
This repository is a first part (back-end) of the project, more will come later.

## WORK IN PROGRESS
